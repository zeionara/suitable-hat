A boy was feeling very nervous about his first date, and so went to his father for advice."My son, there are three subjects that always work with women: food, family, and philosophy."The boy picks up his date and they stare at each other for a long time. The boy's nervousness builds, but he then remembers his father's advice and asks the girl,"Do you like potato pancakes?""No," comes the answer, and the silence returns like a suffocating blanket."Do you have a brother?""No."After giving it some thought, the boy plays his last card: "If you had a brother, would he like potato pancakes?"
