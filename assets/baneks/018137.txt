Zebra dies. It goes to heaven and meets Saint Peter. - Zebra, - he says. - You were a good animal, you lived a great life, so welcome to Heaven. If you have any questions, be free to ask.- Well... - zebra thinks for a moment. - For all my life I've been thinking, am I a black zebra with white stripes or a white zebra whith black stripes?Saint Peter closes his eyes and breathes deeply.- I'm not able to answer you this question, - he says. - You need to go to God. Zebra goes to God, stands a great queue and few days later it meets Saint Peter again.- Oh, hello, Zebra! How are you? Do you like your new home? Is everything alright? - Yes, thank you. Everything is fine, - it smiles. - Have you been to God's office? - asks Saint Peter.- Yes, I have.- So, did he answer your question?- Well... Hi did, - says zebra. - But I didn't understand him. - So, what was his answer? - asks Saint Peter.- He said, you are, what you are.- Oh, that's quite easy! - smiles Saint Peter. - You are probably a white zebra with black stripes.- But how do you know? - zebra was amazed.- Because if you were a black zebra with white stripes, the God would say, you is what you is.
