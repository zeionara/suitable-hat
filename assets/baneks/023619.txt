A panda walks into a restaurant, sits down and orders a meal. After finishing it, the panda pulls out a gun and shoots the waiter, and then stands up to go. "No!" - the waiter yells in pain - "Why are you doing this?""I am a panda. Look it up." - answers the panda before walking out of the restaurant.With the last of his strength, the waiter picks up a dictionary, finds the word "Panda" and reads the definition:"A tree-dwelling marsupial of Asian origin.Characterised by distinct black and white colouring.Eats shoots and leaves."
