An English couple decided to adopt a little German boy. After two years, the child doesn’t speak and his parents start to worry about him. After three years, he still has not spoken and after four years, he has yet to utter a word.The English couple figure he is never going to speak but he is still a lovely child, and on his next birthday, they threw him a party and made him a chocolate cake with orange icing. The parents are in the kitchen when the boy comes in and says, “Mother, Father, I do not care for the orange icing on the chocolate cake.”My God,” says his mother. “You can speak?”To which the German boy replies, “Of course.”"How come you've never spoken before?“ asks his father.“Well,” says the boy, “up until now, everything has been satisfactory.”
