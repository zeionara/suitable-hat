One day a man and his wife were walking down the street when they came across a penguin. “Oh!” exclaimed the man. “What a surprise! What will we do with it?” “I know,” said his wife. We will ask a policeman.” So, they found a policeman and explained what had happened. “Mmm,” said the policeman, I think the best thing is to take it to the zoo.” “What a good idea!” said the woman. We will go there straight away.” The next morning the policeman was walking down the same street when he saw the couple again with the penguin. “I thought I told you to take that penguin to the zoo,” the policeman said. “Well, we did,” said the man. “We took it to the zoo and we all had a really good time. So, this afternoon we are taking it to the cinema, and this evening we are having a meal in a fish restaurant.”
