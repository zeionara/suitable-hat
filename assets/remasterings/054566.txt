A radio station was running a competition – words that weren’t in the dictionary yet could still be used in a sentence that would make logical sense. The prize was a trip to Bali.DJ: “96 FM here, what’s your name?”Caller: “Hi, my name’s Dave.” DJ: “Dave, what’s your word?”Caller: “Goan... spelt G-O-A-N pronounced ‘go-an’.”DJ: “You are correct, Dave, ‘goan’ is not in the dictionary. Now, for a trip to Bali: What sentence can you use that word in that would make sense?”Caller: “Goan fuck yourself!”The DJ cut the caller off and took other calls, all unsuccessful until:DJ: “96 FM, what’s your name?”Caller: “Hi, me name’s Jeff.”DJ: “Jeff, what’s your word?”Caller: “Smee, spelt S-M-E-E, pronounced ‘smee’.”DJ: “You are correct, Jeff, ‘smee’ is not in the dictionary. Now, for a trip to Bali: What sentence can you use that word in that would make sense?”Caller: “Smee again! Goan fuck yourself!”
