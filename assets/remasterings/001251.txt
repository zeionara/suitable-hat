World War III.George Bush and Colin Powell were sitting together at a bar. The bartender was surprised to see them and walked over to them."What are you guys talking about?" he says to them."Well," Bush respones "We were just talking about WW3. We are gonna kill 40 million Iraquies and one vegan."Why would you kill a vegan?" The bartender asks puzzled. Bush then turns to Powell and says "Because i am a vegan".
