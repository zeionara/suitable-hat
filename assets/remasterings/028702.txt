A guy brings a dog to a talent agent, explains the dog can talk. The agent is openly skeptical but agrees to give the guy three minutes. He turns to the dog and says, "OK Fido, what do you call the top of a house?""Roof!""How does sandpaper feel?" "Rough!""Who was the greatest Baseball player of all time?""Ruth!"At this point the agent loses his patience and kicks them both out onto the curb. The dog turns to the man and says: "Why you lookin at the and of fuckin anek, asshole?"
